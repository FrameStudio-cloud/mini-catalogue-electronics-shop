/**
 * Tracks whether the data layer is actually reaching keel-api.
 *
 * The problem it exists to solve is present in this app verbatim. All three reads
 * end in a catch that returns a plausible-looking fallback, so a dead API is
 * indistinguishable from a healthy one:
 *
 *   catalogue -> config/catalogue.js -> the site looks like a normal small shop
 *   banners   -> no hero / no announcement bar -> they silently vanish
 *   settings  -> config/shop.js -> the footer shows the demo address and hours
 *
 * Every one of those fails invisibly. A visitor sees a complete, believable site
 * with placeholder content and no indication anything is wrong, and so do we.
 *
 * A module-level store with useSyncExternalStore rather than context, so any
 * component can read it without provider nesting or threaded props.
 *
 * Every transition also goes to the Keel Analytics SDK, which writes
 * health_ok/health_fail into site_events. The two consumers need different shapes
 * — this store answers "what should the visitor see right now", the SDK answers
 * "what happened, and when did it change" — so they share the report functions
 * rather than sharing state.
 *
 * State shape:
 *   { resources: { [name]: { ok, at, error, failures } } }
